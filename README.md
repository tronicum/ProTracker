# ProTracker

**Live:** <https://andremichelle.github.io/ProTracker/>

Peter "Crayon" Hanning's original ProTracker 2.3A CIA playroutine, running as
68000 machine code inside a small purpose-built Amiga emulator compiled to
WebAssembly. Only what the routine touches is emulated: chip RAM, the 68000,
Paula's four audio DMA channels, the CIA-B timers that pace playback, and the
three exec calls the routine makes to get its interrupt.

The project started as an emulation of Karsten Obarski's Ultimate SoundTracker
V1.8 binary, which is why the exports are still prefixed `ust_`. That backend
was removed: it played its own 1988 format faithfully but nothing from the
ProTracker era.

## The routine

`emu/pt/PT-CIAPlay.s` is `PT-CIAPlay.s` from the ProTracker 2.3 release A
disk, the playroutine Crayon shipped for use in demos and games (its header
still says "V2.1A Playroutine, Mushroom Studios 1992"). It is unmodified apart
from line endings. `emu/pt/ptglue.s` wraps it with a 44 byte entry table and
a level 6 interrupt handler that does what exec's `ciab.resource` would do:
read the CIA interrupt register and call the vector the routine registered
with `AddICRVector`. Both are assembled into `assets/ptplay`, an AmigaDOS hunk
executable:

```
vasmm68k_mot -Fhunkexe -nocase -o assets/ptplay emu/pt/ptglue.s
```

vasm is at <http://sun.hasenbraten.de/vasm/> (`make CPU=m68k SYNTAX=mot`).
`-nocase` is needed because the source mixes `mt_counter` and `mt_Counter`.

At load time the emulator answers `OpenResource("ciab.resource")`,
`OpenLibrary("graphics.library")` (the routine reads `DisplayFlags` to pick
PAL) and `AddICRVector`/`RemICRVector` with stubs. From then on the routine
programs CIA-B timer A itself (1773447 / BPM E-clock cycles, 50 Hz at 125)
and talks to Paula directly.

Modules are copied to `$80000`, where the glue's `mt_data` points, with one
change ProTracker's own loader also makes: a sample repeat length of 0
becomes 1, and loops running past the sample end are clamped. Without it the
routine writes `AUDxLEN = 0`, Paula plays 65536 words, and a drum is followed
by whatever lies behind it in memory ("super mario land" does this on samples
2, 3 and 4). Old 15 instrument SoundTracker files are padded to the 31
instrument layout by the web page (`web/mod15.js`), as ProTracker does.

## Layout

```
assets/       ptplay (routine + glue), ust.wasm (built),
              mods/ (the 8bitboy collection + index.json for the dropdown);
              served as Vite's public dir
emu/ust.c     the emulator and its C API
emu/pt/       PT-CIAPlay.s (original), ptglue.s
emu/musashi/  Musashi 68000 core (Karl Stenerud, MIT), configured as a plain 68000;
              the FPU/softfloat files stay only because m68kcpu.c includes them
emu/native/   command line harness that renders a module to WAV
emu/build.sh  builds assets/ust.wasm (emcc) and emu/native/ust-native (cc)
src/          the web app: openDAW SDK (lib-jsx, lib-dom, lib-std), TypeScript, Vite
tools/        comparison tools
compare/      A/B page against reference renders
```

## WASM API

Built with `STANDALONE_WASM`, no imports. Pointers are offsets into the
exported `memory`.

| export | purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ust_init(sampleRate)` | reset the machine |
| `ust_scratch()`, `ust_scratch_size()` | 1 MB staging buffer for file data |
| `ust_load_program(ptr, len)` | load `assets/ptplay`; the routine installs its CIA interrupt |
| `ust_load_module(ptr, len)` | load a 31 instrument module verbatim, run `mt_init` |
| `ust_play()`, `ust_stop()` | set `mt_Enable` / call `mt_end` |
| `ust_render(frames)` | advance CPU, CIA and Paula; output in `ust_out_l()` / `ust_out_r()` (float, ≤ 4096 frames) |
| `ust_set_filter(0/1)`, `ust_set_led(0/1)` | A500 output filter model and the LED filter (the routine switches it with `E0x`) |
| `ust_set_declick(0/1)` | 1 ms ramps on volume changes and note starts, like modern players do; off by default, since Paula produces hard steps and the routine writes volumes before restarting DMA |
| `ust_song_pos()`, `ust_row()`, `ust_speed()`, `ust_tempo()`, `ust_tick_hz()`, `ust_pattern()`, `ust_song_len()`, `ust_title()`, `ust_cell(ch)` | replayer state |
| `ust_chan_period(ch)`, `ust_chan_volume(ch)`, `ust_chan_dma(ch)` | Paula register view |

## The app

`src/` is a Vite + TypeScript app built on the openDAW SDK, following the
openDAW studio conventions: components take a `Construct` with a `lifecycle`
that owns their subscriptions, models are `DefaultObservableValue`s,
stylesheets are adopted per component (`@opendaw/lib-jsx`, `@opendaw/lib-dom`,
`@opendaw/lib-std`, colour tokens from `@opendaw/studio-enums`). `Player` owns the AudioContext and the worklet
(`src/worklet/processor.ts`, bundled with `?worker&url`); the WASM bytes are
compiled inside the worklet because Chrome does not deliver a posted
`WebAssembly.Module` to one. `PatternView` is the step table: the 64 rows of
the current pattern with the playing row fixed in the middle, `Positions` the
song's position list, `Channels` the four Paula channels. The transport can
switch between the tracker layout and an audio-reactive ASCII spectrum view.

```
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:8080
npm run build      # dist/, base path /ProTracker/
npm run wasm       # rebuild assets/ust.wasm and the native harness
```

Pushing to `main` deploys `dist/` to GitHub Pages through
`.github/workflows/pages.yml` (set the repository's Pages source to "GitHub
Actions" once). The committed `assets/ust.wasm` is what gets deployed, so
rebuild it with `npm run wasm` after changing the emulator.

## Testing against references

Two renderers are useful as references, both installable with Homebrew:

* **UADE** (`brew install uade`) runs a real Amiga replayer on UAE's chipset
  emulation. It is the reference for the hardware side. Render with
  `uade123 -f out.wav -e wav --frequency=48000 --filter=NONE --panning=0 -t 90 -1 file.mod`.
* **libopenmpt** (`brew install libopenmpt`) interprets the format with modern
  ProTracker semantics. Render with `openmpt123 --render --output-type wav
  --samplerate 48000 --no-float file.mod`. Its waveforms do not line up with
  Paula-based renderers (0.35 correlation against UADE), so compare envelopes
  and spectra, not samples.

The native harness renders through the emulator:

```
emu/native/ust-native assets/ptplay song.mod out.wav 90 [filter 0/1] [led 0/1]
```

Tools:

* `tools/abcompare.py A.wav B.wav [seconds]` aligns B to A and prints the
  waveform correlation per second, to locate where two players disagree.
* `tools/specdiff.py A.wav B.wav seconds out.png` (numpy, matplotlib) prints
  1 ms envelope correlation, per-second spectral correlation and local lag,
  and draws both spectrograms.

Results against UADE, filters off on both sides: "delicate" (emax/TRSI) aligns
within 0.3 ms, equal level, 1 ms envelope correlation 0.985/0.94, waveform
correlation 0.94 to 0.99 per second after allowing a local lag of up to
170 µs; "super mario land" 0.96/0.98 envelope, 0.85 to 0.98 waveform. The
lag comes from Paula's per-scanline DMA slots, which UAE models and this
emulator does not; it is below audibility.
